This Terraform code defines the necessary resources for the architecture diagram, including Amazon Cognito User Pool, API Gateway, Lambda functions, IAM roles, Route 53, CloudFront, ACM Certificate, and DynamoDB table. Note that you may need to adjust the configurations based on your specific requirements and add additional resources as needed.

The `{}` placeholders are replaced with the appropriate module definitions for the Lambda functions. In this case, a `modules/lambda` module is used to define the Lambda functions and their configurations.
